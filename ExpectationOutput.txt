Client Program & Visualization
We have provided a client program that will allow you to test your Repository implementation by creating and manipulating repositories. The client program will directly call the methods you implement in your Repository class and will show you the resulting changes to the repositories. Click "Expand" below to see a sample execution of the client (user input is bold and underlined).

Welcome to the Mini-Git test client!
Use this program to test your Mini-Git repository implemenation.
Make sure to test all operations in all cases --
some cases are particularly tricky.
